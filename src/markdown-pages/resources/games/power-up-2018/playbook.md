This playbook illustrates what strategies we can implement during the competition. Keep in mind that these strategies are kept vague because we cannot account for every situation they are meant as a template for a match that can be altered given the in-game experience.

It is assumed that all robots can push Cubes into the Exchange and score them. It is assumed that all robots can put cubes on the Switch if they can put cubes on the Scale.

Key:

C : Control

S : Scale

Sw : Switch

Ex : Exchange

B : Block

E : Enemy

F : Friend

(CSw) : Control Switch if Friends cannot do it in Autonomous
