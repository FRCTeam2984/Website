Here you can see our robot on the blue alliance, our robot had a elevated chassis that could push around the soccer balls. We were not very fast so it was easy for robots to block us from scoring.

[Qualification 61 at San Diego](https://www.thebluealliance.com/match/2010sdc_qm61)

# Our Plan

Our robot's high chassis made it harder for balls to fall into our electronics allowing us to hit balls with more confidence. Our robot was quite slow this year and lacked maneuverability to make it past other robots.

We completely avoided climbing at the end to focus on scoring soccer balls.

# Our Shortcomings

Our robot was quite slow this year and lacked maneuverability to make it past other robots. Either we should have spent more time making a lighter robot or spent more time driving to help maneuverability.

Our robot also lacked any climbing mechanism which severely limited our full effectiveness because other teams who couldn't climb focused solely on us during the climbing phase.
