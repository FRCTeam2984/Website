WE FINALLY WON THIS YEAR!!! During our Las Vegas Regional we were picked to be on an alliance that ended up winning the Las Vegas Regional. This was a great year for us and we should follow this as an example for future years.

This is a video from the San Diego Regional. This is not the regional we won at but it still shows how great our robot was

# Our Plan

Just like all the other robots our robot was designed to have a grabber that could be moved to variable heights to put the balloons on different pegs. Our robot was not different but we had a great driver and operator which really set us apart from the competition.

This was the only year that we had a driver practice every single day of the build season and then some. In today's competitions there is a lot more diversity among teams but the driver skill is still very important.

# Our Shortcomings

Honestly this was a great year but what this year lacked was a schedule. There was no set deadlines that needed to be met at certain times. Without these deadlines we lose the focus that can be the difference between winning and losing a competition.
