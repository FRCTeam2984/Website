Our robot moves, bugs are being fixed and a new plan are being made, with a series of problems and little time to fix them it is the time for innovation, it's almost the last minute but there is time yet for us to innovate.

Less importantly horseplay is banned in the shop, don't do it, it is a bad thing. As people will soon understand, our robot is somewhat near completion and just the tail end of the problems to be revised, it will soon be revealed if we overreached or not.

A new event has happened, our resident members will continue to work to optimal conditions.
