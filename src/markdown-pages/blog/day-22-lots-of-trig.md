Half way through the season and half way through the building phase. Today is the second day full of trig and calculations to further discuss the feasibility of our scale mechanism.

Here is Tahseen the Hacker...hes really good at hacking

Mechanical is busy discussing the feasibility of the scale and creating mock-ups to make sure the scale mechanism is possible. Mechanical is a bit stressed today with only three members to create all the mechanisms for the robot.

Communications is creating brochures to explain what our robot, as well as learning how to implement an atom feed to our website. Logistics is working on contacting old sponsors to see if they would like to sponsor us again.

Electrical split up into groups again to update the Roborio as well as test the encoders without using the arm. Drive team is continuing to develop strategies.
