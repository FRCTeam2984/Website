So this will be a quick one.

Mechanical is still trying to finish the Arm so they can attach it to the Robot a few days before the end of the build season.

Look at that they have the arm done and are ready to mount it on the robot.

Electrical is a little bored with no wiring, programming or optimizing left to do.

Drive Team built a really big course to drive in but Mechanical needed the robot right after they built it so they have a great sadness in their heart.

Communications is contacting other teams as to try and figure out a way to record matches and Logistics is now onto Competition Logistics. Who will go? Who will bring the robot? Who will give rides? Tune in tomorrow for the thrilling conclusion
