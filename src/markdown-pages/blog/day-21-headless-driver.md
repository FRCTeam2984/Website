Marshall is yet again sick and I have to take over writing his daily job. Dylan is gone, I believe that Marshall had some effect on his absence...

Mechanical is busy getting data on the mechanisms to try and find the optimal length for the Fixed(Intake) and the launch distance for the Sorcerer(Scale Scorer).

Here is the Driver using the robot's new mechanism called Sorcerer. It's pretty cool if you ask me...

..although it is still pretty dangerous...

Communications is focused on finding quotes for Vikings pins as well as finding what stickers are going to be on the robot. We are also focused on fixing validation errors on this website and giving descriptive subtitles for the blogs.

Drive team is running a obstacle course to get better at driving while Logistics is finding the team's contacts to past sponsors to update continuity.

The Driver and Operator are getting pretty good at grabbing and releasing cubes.

Electrical and Software is doing a lot of things today. One group is finding the best settings to allow the robot to travel to the Scale or the Switch, they are also calibrating encoders. While the other group is focusing on the tuning PID which allows for smoother turning and creating arm control software to allow for more stability.

The mood is sad and quiet.
