Electrical made an oopsie, our valiant head of electrical accidentally spray painted the floor, no evidence remains however a reminder that spray paint is not to be applied without proper supervision and proper procedure must be followed while applying spray paint to anything.

Our valiant mechanical team continues by practicing using the equipment as well as finalizing the design for intake and robot. Their design shall hopefully be a good one while they also attempt to cause everyone else in robotics hearing loss.

Communications might actually finish something for once on the bright side, and drive team just hasn't seemed to appear anywhere.

The season might be successful, we hope for good fortune and pray that it works.
