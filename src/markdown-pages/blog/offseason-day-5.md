Mechanical is working on Cad Projects and minor alteration to the robot physically.

Software is troubleshooting to fix a problem with autonomous where it causes the robot to drive crooked for some reason, also finalizing some autonomous pathways

Logistics is pulling up this years budget so we can start planning for next year

Drive team is busy driving and keeping everything under wraps and teaching a new operator how to drive. Practicing has been prevalent today

Lastly Communications has to keep steady at all angles as were taking many different missions such as updating our own literature, finding people to apply for grants, seeing if we can have presentations in the middle school and this school to recruit new members. And upon that a load of other networking and keeping the website ready by adding a donation button and new page etc. Were staying afloat

Mood is: Mild pressure
