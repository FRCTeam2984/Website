We tried, and failed to get a sponsorship from the pearl of pizza, but we're gonna email them so all hope is not lost, just most of it. Everyone was counting on me and the pizza I bought from them afterwards tasted of sadness and also spiciness because I drowned it in crushed red peppers.

Electrical is finishing the electrical board for the robot(It has all the nerd parts on it), re-organizing the electronics on the robot, and briefing Mechanical about changes to the bot.

Mechanical is buildin' more parts for the robot, reworking the robot to make it better, "Maybe assembling" according to the head of mechanical. They are also attaching the electronics plate (as mentioned previously) and a battery below

Drive team is doing drills, maneuvers, and seeing if they can deconstruct a pyramid of cubes.

Communications has finished all the issues with the website, so now we can focus on all stylizing. so thats kinda cool I guess. Everyone does not realize whats going on and I feel completely alone in this world.
Mood is Serbia
Quote of the day is "I want to learn a language no one else knows, so i can talk to myself but in foreign"

Love you, Marshall.
