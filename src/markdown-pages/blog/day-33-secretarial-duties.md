Wassup~
Marshall's not here today. So his equally good-at-writing secretary, Niki, is here. Today has felt pretty lackluster so far but we have some noteworthy accomplishments.

The Drive Team is starting some drills and working on their skills. I'd say they're doing well- oh wait nevermind they ran into a cube. Otherwise, it's going well here.

Electronics and Programming are still doing the autonomous mode, at least thats what they told me. I'm not convinced yet.

Mechanical is working on building an arm for the robot, it looks alright but Max seems to think it could use a bit more improvement. And once Mechanical finishes that, Electronics can do something else besides autonomous!!!!!!!!

Communications has been doing more stylizing stuff and obviously writing the reiteration of the bible. It seems like the team has gotten smaller since we started. Although I haven't counted Lukas or Warren as people lately, so maybe it's just that.

Logistics has to get a budget together and order the pins or something...*cough* Alex Please *cough*

I don't really know what else to say, so imagine that I'm Marshall and I said something funny. *insert laugh here*

The mood today is "the same"

The quote today is "We have infrared sensors...we can be a roomba bot"
