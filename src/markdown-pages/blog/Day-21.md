The past week has been very slow, while the robot slowly gets completed, there are 16 meetings left in the season.
With 16 meetings left, our logistics team lead has become antsy and made threats of violence to create enough buzz to
create a blogpost. While this is likely in jest, the regular Saturday blogpost will also be posted on Saturday.

As always, please donate and tell mechanical to hurry it up.
