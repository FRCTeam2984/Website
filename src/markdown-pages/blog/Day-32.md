Today has been a day marked by paper airplanes and lead pellets, as bugs in the code are narrowed down, it is up to us to find the causes of the bugs and fix them, a major bug still has no fix but is being worked upon. Mechanical continues a careful assembly of the climbing mechanisms which must be measured properly or risk failure.

Paper airplanes are fun thing, today our president tried to eat one, paper airplanes are no longer fun.
