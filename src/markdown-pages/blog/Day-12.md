Welcome to the season kick off, with kick off comes announcements and the game, for announcements, we will no longer be accepting new members while the season is in progress, as well as for members, meetings will now last until 6 except otherwise specified, and lunch will be provided on the weekends.

The game has been outlined in multiple videos and pdfs, which will be added to the resources section of the website. Vikings Robotics would also appreciate that before coming to the meeting that a clear understanding of the rules of the game are had before coming to the meeting, as there will not be time to bring you up to speed.
