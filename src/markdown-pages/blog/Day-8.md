Welcome to the quite nearly regularly updated blog where we will say what happened, what will happen
and not make racist comments to offend people. Electrical and software has decided they don't understand the code
of the previous years robot and have decided to redesign the architecture used to build the robot.
They are motivated people who believe in themselves, they have begun a myriad of tasks to do so.

Drive team has decided that they are taking volunteers to replace the current people on drive team.

We at Vikings robotics have a firm belief that we can do whatever we put our minds to however,
we can't do it without support. We thank all of our sponsors, donors, and families who contribute to us
and offer our sincerest gratitude to them.
