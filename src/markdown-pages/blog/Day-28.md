Mechanical has decided that the climb mechanism may be ready at some point within the week, we all hope and pray for this to work. however there is a strategy with which we may do this without attaching it. Electrical is dealing with a series of bugs that we have encountered which will hopefully be fixed.

A series of other problems need to be addressed in the meantime, team morale is slowly falling however this might be remedied soon. While we are behind schedule there is still hope and our valiant team members are willing to help us pull through.
