It's the day before bag and tag, we are on schedule to finish the robot between bag and tag, mechanical has attached climb mechanism to the robot, electrical has finally fixed a bug that has plagued our usage of mekanim wheels, an inability to move sideways at slow speeds. With that problem fixed our drive team has been practicing with the robot to determine if their are other bugs or  whether we will be ready for competition.
