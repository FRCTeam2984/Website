During our Las Vegas Regional we were picked to be on an alliance that ended up winning the Las Vegas Regional. This was a great year for us and we should follow this as an example for future years.</p>\n<p>This is a video from the San Diego Regional. This is not the regional we won at but it still shows how great our robot was</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thebluealliance.com/match/2011sdc_qm4\">Qualification 4 at San Diego</a></p>\n<h1>Our Plan</h1>\n<p>Just like all the other robots our robot was designed to have a grabber that could be moved to variable heights to put the balloons on different pegs. Our robot was not different but we had a great driver and operator which really set us apart from the competition.</p>\n<p>This was the only year that we had a driver practice every single day of the build season and then some. In today's competitions there is a lot more diversity among teams but the driver skill is still very important.</p>\n<h1>Our Shortcomings</h1>\n<p>Honestly this was a great year but what this year lacked was a schedule. There was no set deadlines that needed to be met at certain times. Without these deadlines we lose the focus that can be the difference between winning and losing a competition.</p>\n<h1>The Game</h1>\n<div class=\"videowrapper\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxujTCgQPgg\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/resources/games/logomotion-2011/index","title":"Logomotion 2011"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
