Our robot focused on scoring in the low goal a rather common design.</p>\n<p>Even though our robot had a common design and was frankly not great at scoring we had a somewhat big frame that could be used to block other robots.</p>\n<p>Our team placed in the lower half of teams that year which was the start of our gradual decline.</p>\n<h1>Our Shortcomings</h1>\n<p>There are several videos from our matches on the Blue Alliance website: <a href=\"https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2984/2014\">https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2984/2014</a></p>\n<p>From these it seems that our team could have benefited from more drive training or coordination in the Drive Team. A lot of the time our robot didn't avoid other robots and chose to ram into other robots leaving us vulnerable to a penalty.</p>\n<h1>The Game</h1>\n<div class=\"videowrapper\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5zWzICG5to\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/resources/games/aerial-assist-2014/index","title":"Aerial Assist 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
