In which case we've been having a grand old time constructing and settling in to a second week of robotics. A Lot has happened this well so here's the recap.</p>\n<p>Mechanical has built the platforms and other field elements, and has also made an intake for the robot to grab the hatch panels.</p>\n<p>Electrical has been building a dashboard to look at all the stats of the robot and also making software so the camera knows where it's going during autonomous.</p>\n<p>Communications has been working with drive team to make shirts and learn how to drive and we've kinda semi merged into one niche team.</p>\n<p>Logistics has been making money and filing but has really been lacking because now it's build season</p>\n<p>We're also constructing a printer for Mrs Stuart and having a great time.
