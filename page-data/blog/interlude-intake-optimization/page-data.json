The top of the intake wheels was about 6 inches from the ground. Full power was applied to the intake motors and the chassis was driven forward. Both chassis and cube (with cover) were placed on a well-worn carpet. Three feeding situations were used: face; edge, and tilted (between face and edge). Scores are reported as the fraction of five intakes that completed face-on.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trial</th>\n<th>Back Width</th>\n<th>Arm Length</th>\n<th>Gap</th>\n<th>Orientation</th>\n<th>Score</th>\n<th>Wheels</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>16 9/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>3/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>16 9/16</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>3/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>16 9/16</td>\n<td>Tilted</td>\n<td>2/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>8 1/2</td>\n<td>16 7/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>4/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>8 1/2</td>\n<td>16 7/16</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>4/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>8 1/2</td>\n<td>16 7/16</td>\n<td>Tilted</td>\n<td>4/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>16 9/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>16 9/16</td>\n<td>Vertex</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>Cracking sound on second trial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>19 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>16 9/16</td>\n<td>Tilted</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>17 1/4</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>17 1/4</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>4/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td>Bent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>17 1/4</td>\n<td>Tilted</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>3/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Tilted</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>4/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Tilted</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>50% power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>50% power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Tilted</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>50% power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>5/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>top of wheels flush with top of cube</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>1/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>top of wheels flush with top of cube, cube tilted forward on failures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Face</td>\n<td>4/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>top of wheels 3 inches from top of cube, can't eject</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>20 1/2</td>\n<td>9 1/2</td>\n<td>7 9/16</td>\n<td>Edge</td>\n<td>2/5</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n<td>top of wheels 3 inches from top of cube, can't eject</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Best results were obtained with a 20 1/2 inch base and 9 1/2 inch arms. Blue or green wheels performed equivalently.</p>\n<p>Narrow intakes were more prone to damage by edge-fed cubes. This is understandable given that the edge-fed configuration is about two inches wider than the face-fed configuration.</p>\n<p>Intakes mounted with the top of wheels against the top of the cube misfed in edge-feed situations. The cube tilted forward, rather than being drawn in parallel to the ground.</p>\n<p>Intakes mounted with wheels three inches from the top of the cube could ingest, but not eject a cube. Intake wheels lost traction after becoming lodged within the cutout forming the handle of the milk crate. As a result, any intake system based on this design must be mounted with the top of the intake wheels no higher than 7 1/2 inches from the ground.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/interlude-intake-optimization","title":"Interlude: Optimization of a Simple Power Cube Intake"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
